Our town's municipal board is trying to raise the property tax on the house by a seemingly arbitrary amount, initially by about 50%!, even though no major improvements had been made to the house. 
Upon appeal, they smugly deflected inquiries and were not capable of providing, though they settled on a 30% increase
Here I leverage, Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape relevant data in our neighborhood to build a predictive model with the goal of answering the following two questions:
  1 - What raise in my property tax should be fair?
  2 - What raise in my property tax can I expect from this delightful gathering of "experts"?
